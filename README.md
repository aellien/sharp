# Jitter radiation

Implementation of jitter radiations in PyXspec following instructions from the PyXspec extended manual (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/python/html/extended.html). Our user defined model can be found in 'def_jitter_model.py'. A quick example script is also available with 'example.py'.

The theoretical description of the model, as well as a detailed description of each parameter can be found in the associated SHARP report and references therein. Further documentation might be produced in the future.

Requirements: HEASoft, Xspec, PyXspec.

Future updates: a Fortran version of these routines will be developed in order to be used directly in Xspec, without the obligation to go through PyXpsec.

If any question please contact AmaÃ«l Ellien (a.r.j.ellien@uva.nl) or Jacco Vink (j.vink@uva.nl).

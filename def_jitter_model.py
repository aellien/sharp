def jitter(engs, params, flux):
    '''
    Calculates the photon spectrum of synchrotron plus jitter radiation. This
    function can be used with the 'addPyMod' method in PyXspec to implement it in
    the Xspec library. It can also be called directly from Python as a generic
    parametric function.

    Arguments
    ----------------

            engs        Energy array. If used in Xspec, this is set by currently
                        used spectrum. If used in Python, should be a Nump 1D array. # keV

            params      Tuple or list of parameter values.

            flux        Output flux array. If used in Xspec, this is set by currently
                        used spectrum. If used in Python, should be a Nump 1D array. # Photon/cm2/s/keV

    Output
    ----------------

            flux        Same as argument.
